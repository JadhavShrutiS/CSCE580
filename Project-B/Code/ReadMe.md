## Download the ProjectB_SJ_RunVersion file to open in code editor to see how that file has been run once
#### ProjectB_SJ_RunVersion will have the cells already run and it will show all the widgets and graphs in the notebook


## ProjectB_SJ file is a clean notebook in Colab
#### None of the cells from ProjectB_SJ are run. It cleanly shows just all of the code.

## IF the colab notebook does not work, here is the explicit link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hnlWbsqAJGVyq9H2EqtlnTqCkIPLtkC0/view?usp=sharing
