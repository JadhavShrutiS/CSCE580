    "Answer: Removing the stop_words was somewhat helpful in revealing more about the class, as now \"Computer Science, Data, and 'May' \" is now revealed. This can tell us that majority of this pool comes from a computer science background, along with that these students must have something related to data. The result however still stays cluttered due to the differences in bullets used, as well as symbols being used to represent stop words, for example: using '&' for 'and'. There also persists a similar problem like analysed in self-resume case, where the number of years just as 2024 or 2025 are more frequently used, that if overlooked may provide a better understanding of the class."
